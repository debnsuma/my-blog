    "text": "Bottlenecks in Single-GPU Training\nWhen training deep learning models on a single GPU, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is utilized by four main types of data:\n\nModel Parameters (\\(\\Phi\\)):\nThe weights being learned during training.\nParameter Gradients (\\(\\nabla \\Phi\\)):\nThe gradients computed during backpropagation, required for parameter updates.\nOptimizer States (\\(\\Phi_{\\text{optim}}\\)):\nAuxiliary variables needed by the optimization algorithm, such as momentum and variance estimates (e.g., in Adam).\nActivations (\\(\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{act}}\\)):\nThe intermediate outputs from each neural network layer required to compute gradients during the backward pass.\n\nOf these, the first three (Parameters, Gradients, and Optimizer States) are considered static components. They collectively define the minimum “static” memory footprint determined by the model architecture itself.\nThe fourth component, Activations, is dynamic and its memory footprint depends on the input size (such as batch size and sequence length). Thus, activations often become the main bottleneck in large-scale training.\n\nStatic Memory\nAnd when we are training if you look at the training loop again, until step optimizer.step(), we need to keep everything in the memory. And after optimizer.step(), we can discard the activations and the gradients. And we can keep the model parameters and the optimizer states in the memory.\nIf \\(\\Psi\\) is the total number of parameters in the model, the total static memory required (\\(\\mathcal{M}_{static}\\)) using the Adam optimizer is a fixed amount: \\(16\\Psi\\) bytes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nPrecision\nSize (\\(\\Psi\\) Bytes)\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nModel Parameters\nBF32 (4 bytes)\n\\(4\\Psi\\)\nUsed for forward and backward passes\n\n\nParameter Gradients\nBF32 (4 bytes)\n\\(4\\Psi\\)\nUsed in backpropagation\n\n\nOptimizer States (Adam)\nFP32 (4+4 bytes)\n\\(8\\Psi\\)\nStores 1st and 2nd moment estimates (\\(4\\Psi\\) each)\n\n\nTotal Static Memory\n\n\\(16\\Psi\\)\nThe absolute floor for static storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy Adam Optimizer Uses \\(4+4\\) Bytes per Parameter\n\n\n\nAdam maintains two additional FP32 (4-byte) tensors per parameter: the first moment (mean of gradients, \\(m\\)) and the second moment (uncentered variance, \\(v\\)). Thus, for each parameter, Adam stores \\(4\\) bytes for \\(m\\) and \\(4\\) bytes for \\(v\\), totaling \\(8\\Psi\\) bytes.\n\n\nAnd when it comes to training a model, its all about how smartly we can manage this memory footprint. In modern LLM training, mixed precision is employed, typically using BF16 (2 bytes) for fast computation while maintaining a full-precision FP32 (4 bytes) copy of weights and optimizer states for numerical stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMixed Precision Training\n\n\n\nMixed Precision Training accelerates deep learning and reduces memory use by combining 16-bit (BF16/FP16) and 32-bit (FP32) floating-point operations.\n\nHow it works: Forward and backward passes use low-precision (e.g., BF16) for parameters and activations, while a full-precision FP32 master copy of weights and optimizer states is kept for numerical stability.\nWhy it matters: Enables training of larger models or larger batches within the same hardware footprint. Mixed precision is now standard in large-scale model training.\n\n\n\nSo, with mixed precision, the breakdown is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nPrecision\nSize (\\(\\Psi\\) Bytes)\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nModel Parameters\nBF16 (2 bytes)\n\\(2\\Psi\\)\nUsed for forward and backward passes\n\n\nParameter Gradients\nBF16 (2 bytes)\n\\(2\\Psi\\)\nUsed in backpropagation\n\n\nMaster Weights\nFP32 (4 bytes)\n\\(4\\Psi\\)\nFull precision copy for the update step\n\n\nOptimizer States (Adam)\nFP32 (4+4 bytes)\n\\(8\\Psi\\)\nStores 1st and 2nd moment estimates (\\(4\\Psi\\) each)\n\n\nTotal Static Memory (with Mixed Precision)\n\n\\(16\\Psi\\)\nThe absolute floor for static storage\n\n\n\nYou might notice that the total static memory remains \\(16\\Psi\\) bytes. So what is the advantage of mixed precision training?\nThe key benefits of mixed precision are:\n\nIncreased Training Speed: As we are using lower-precision data types (like BF16) during forward and backward passes, computation is faster and less memory bandwidth is used.\nReduced Activation Memory: Since our model parameters and optimizer states are stored in FP32, the activations, which are stored in BF16 during training, require half the memory compared to FP32, so the dynamic (activation) memory footprint is significantly lower.\n\nWhile the absolute static memory is unchanged, mixed precision allows for faster training and greater memory efficiency, especially for storing activations, enabling larger models or batches to fit within the same hardware limits.\nAnd this calculation reveals a significant challenge: a 70 Billion parameter model requires approximately \\(70\\text{B} \\times 16 \\text{ bytes} \\approx 1120 \\text{ GB}\\) of static memory. With high-end GPUs typically offering only \\(80 \\text{ GB}\\) of memory, loading even the static state of the model becomes impossible, without considering the dynamic activations.\n\n\nDynamic Memory\nThis component is dependent on the input batch and is the primary cause of memory bottlenecks.\n\nActivations: The output of each layer. They must be stored until the backward pass to compute the gradients.\n\nFor a linear layer \\(y=Wx\\), the gradient for \\(W\\) is calculated as: \\[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} \\cdot x^T\\]\nThis requires saving the layer’s input, \\(x\\) (the activation from the previous layer).\n\nActivation Memory Equation: The total memory required for activations (\\(m_{act}\\)) in mixed precision can be estimated by the following equation: \\[\\mathcal{M}_{\\text{act}} = L \\cdot \\text{seq} \\cdot \\text{bs} \\cdot h \\cdot \\left(34 + \\frac{5 \\cdot n_{heads} \\cdot \\text{seq}}{\\text{h}}\\right)\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(L\\): Number of layers\n\\(\\text{seq}\\): Sequence length\n\\(\\text{bs}\\): Batch size (number of samples)\n\\(h\\): Hidden dimension of the model\n\\(n_{heads}\\): Number of attention heads\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, activation memory usage is not static for a given model; it scales:\n\nLinearly with the batch size (\\(\\text{bs}\\))\nQuadratically with the sequence length (\\(\\text{seq}\\))\n\nAnd this quadratic scaling with \\(\\text{seq}^2\\) (an effect stemming from the attention matrix) means the activation memory is the part that will blow up when you increase the batch size or train with longer sequences."

So, even for one single sequence, the memory required is more than 50 GB. And this is a significant challenge for training large models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGlobal Batch Size\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about batch size in LLM pre-training, we usually refer to it in terms of the number of tokens, not the number of sequences. That is, the token batch size is calculated as sequence length × number of sequences (micro-batch size)\n\n\nTypically, the global batch size used in pre-training is extremely large—usually in the millions of tokens. And in practice, we start the training with a smaller batch size and gradually increase it over the course of training.\n\nSmall Batch Size: Used at the beginning of training when the loss is high. It provides quick, noisy signals that help the model traverse the loss landscape rapidly toward the minima.\nLarge Batch Size: Used as training approaches the optima. It provides a more accurate gradient direction (a clearer signal), which reduces noise and ensures confident, stable convergence."

    "section": "Memory usage in Transformer",
    "text": "Memory usage in Transformer\nTo get a sense of the memory usage in a Transformer, let’s take a look at the memory usage of Llama 3.1 {8B, 70B and 13B} models.\n\n\n\nFrom this graph, we can clearly see that forshort sequences (or small batch sizes), memory usage for activations is almost negligible, but from around 4K-16K tokens they start to take up a significant amount of memory (this is because of the quadratic scaling with the sequence length, which we discussed earlier), while usage for parameters, gradients, and optimizer states is roughly independent of the sequence length and batch size.\nHow can we solve this problem of activation explosion? Can we somehow avoide storing all those activations ?\n\nSolution 1: Activation Recomputation\nRecall why we need to store all those activations in the first place ? It is because we need to compute the gradients for the model parameters. So, if we can somehow avoid storing all those activations, we can save a lot of memory.\nOne effective approach is Gradient Checkpointing also known as Activation Recomputation. With this technique, we discard most of the activations during the forward pass to save memory and recompute them on the fly during the backward pass when gradients are needed.\nNormally, we’d store every hidden state between learnable operations (like feedforward layers, layer norm, etc.) to use them during the backward pass. With activation recomputation, we only store activations at specific checkpoints and recalculate everything else during backpropagation. This helps us manage memory while training large models. The process typically looks like this:\n\n\n\nBut as we know in life, there is no free lunch. Although we save memory by discarding most of the activations during the forward pass, we spend some extra compute to recompute these activations on the fly during the backward pass.\nThere are a few ways to do activation checkpointing, and each involves different memory and compute tradeoffs.\nThe most aggressive approach is called Full Activation Checkpointing, where you only store activations at the end of each layer (instead of storing every intermediate activation). This method is great for memory since you’re keeping so little, but it’s the most compute-heavy, often increasing computation time by 30–40% because you have to recompute almost everything during backpropagation.\nBut do we really need to treat every part of the model the same? By profiling, we find that the main memory culprit is the activations from the Multi-Headed Attention (MHA) layers, since they scale quadratically with sequence length.\nThis leads to a more balanced strategy: Selective Checkpointing. Here, we only skip storing activations for the heavy MHA layers and still store them for the lighter MLP layers. The payoff is impressive: up to 70% memory savings for only about 2.7% extra computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteActivation Checkpointing on Llama 3.1 8B model\n\n\n\nAs you can see the graph bellow, on an 8-billion parameter model with a batch size of 1 and sequence length 4096, activation memory without any checkpointing can hit 97 GB, which is enough to break most GPUs. With selective activation checkpointing, that drops to 17 GB. And with full checkpointing, at the extreme, memory usage can go down to just 1 GB!\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we’ve learned about recomputation, we can tame the activation memory usage we saw in the previous graphs!\nHowever, activations still have a linear dependence on the batch size, so as we move to larger batch sizes this might become an issue again. Fortunately, we have a second tool in our box - gradient accumulation to the rescue!"
