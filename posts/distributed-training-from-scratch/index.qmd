## Introduction

Distributed training has become essential for training large-scale deep learning models. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of distributed training and implement key concepts from scratch.

## Why Distributed Training?

As models grow larger and datasets expand, training on a single GPU becomes impractical. Distributed training allows us to:

- **Scale training across multiple GPUs or machines**
- **Reduce training time significantly**
- **Handle larger models that don't fit in single GPU memory**
- **Process larger batch sizes for better convergence**

## Core Concepts

### Data Parallelism

The most common approach where each device holds a complete copy of the model and processes different batches of data.

### Model Parallelism

Splitting the model itself across multiple devices, necessary when the model is too large for a single device.

### Gradient Synchronization

The key challenge in distributed training is synchronizing gradients across all devices to ensure consistent model updates.

## Implementation Approaches

We'll explore several approaches to distributed training:

1. **AllReduce** - Efficient gradient aggregation
2. **Parameter Server** - Centralized coordination
3. **Ring AllReduce** - Bandwidth-optimal communication

## Coming Soon

In the following sections, we'll implement these concepts from scratch using PyTorch and explore:

- Communication primitives
- Gradient aggregation strategies
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Performance optimization techniques

Stay tuned for detailed implementations and benchmarks!
